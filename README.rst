Why "Waliki" ?
----------------

**Waliki** is an `Aymara <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aymara_language>`_ word
that means *All right*, *Fine*.

It has punch, sounds a bit like *Wiki*, has a meaningful sense for this project
and also plays with the idea of using a "non mainstream" language (*wiki* a hawaiian word)

And last but not less important, it's a humble tribute to bolivian President Evo Morales
who was `kidnapped <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/03/bolivia-un-evo-morales-plane>`_ in Europe.
